After 15 years traveling the world, I put down my suitcases and my camera but I continued to broaden my horizons by getting into web development. After a first stage of training as a web developer with Openclassrooms, always looking for new challenges, I continued my apprenticeship within the LMWR agency under a professional contract while seeking the title of designer and application developer. I now wish to combine my new skills with my varied professional experiences and aim to integrate a company with an innovative, enthusiastic and daring culture. Here you will have an overview of the various projects that I have developed. Let's meet to discuss it!
